Nothing wrong with updates on your life, but when you’re coming out with 3 episodes a week, how much of an update can there be? Kaitlyn has said before it’s hard to find new content and guests for so many episodes a week — so cut them down???!? (That seems like common sense???)\\n\\nToo many episodes has made it watered down. I’d prefer one REALLY good episode a week that’s actually focused on the topic it’s titled rather than a bunch of what feels like half-assed podcasts. It doesn’t feel like there’s any planned content. It’s just Kaitlyn in front of a mic saying whatever comes to mind and it’s not interesting anymore.

While the hosts are entitled to their opinions, I cannot support a podcast that shows such a bias and considers homosexuality to not be family friendly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "89117    I listened to Podcast Winterfell for 2 years, I loved it. The original host left this wonderful podcast to people that doesn't make the cut, they make theory from nothing, they do not provide some evidence and I thinks is just a piece of trash. I am sorry, I used to love this podcast, but now is just one more of the one million Game of Thrones podcasts in the wild.

       "249969   I’m never one to leave a review, but this last podcast begged for one. Used to love this podcast, but now it seems like all Stassi and her guest do is complain. Yes she has the occasional guest, but even then all they do whine. Please don’t feel obligated to put out a podcast every week simply to just put something out there.

       "250477   I really used to love this podcast. She lost me in her podcast when she referred to black people as \"them\". A little too out of touch white privilege for me. Her blatant victim blaming with the me too movement is deplorable. She won’t grow and learn. It’s ALL words to keep her pockets full. How many chances does she need?

       "311064   I used to love this podcast and listen to it religiously. I truly believe Becca and Tanya are good people but a lot of the language they use recently has left me and other conservative listeners feeling alienated. They make it seem like if you don’t prescribe to their way of thinking, you’re part of the problem, even if I really do care about those issues I just have different solutions in mind. Their FB group also has a  no politics allowed rule but they allow any post about BLM because it’s considered “social justice” so it comes across as very hypocritical.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "311192   Sorry guys I used to love this podcast....but I have to say goodbye. It’s funny because one of the rules of their fb group is “no politics”....they broke that when they started talking about politics. Basically saying that rioting, looting, ruining people’s livelihoods and people literally dying at the hands of these rioters is fine, it’s all good because it is something that “needs to happen for things to change.” Comparing it to the Boston tea party...Are you kidding me?! What a joke. \\nWish this podcast was still a positive place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

I support Becca and Tanya and will continue to follow them on their social media platforms, but I will get my political “news” from other sources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "311543   I used to LOVE this podcast and couldn’t wait for the next week’s episode. But just a warning, if you do not agree with their opinions, which run greatly with what’s popular in the media, then do not voice it on the scrubbing in Facebook group because it will be deleted. So sad they say they welcome everyone’s thoughts but don’t actually accept them. It’s becoming a podcast to only support a certain group of audience. Don’t go against the grain because it will be rejected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "505611   I used to love this podcast and it was my go to bachelor podcast, but it is so bad now. The ads (crate and barrel specifically) are out of control. I never want to shop at crate and barrel again after listening to one podcast. Thankfully Ashley’s wedding is over because i was so tired or hearing about every little thing. She could turn any conversation somehow back to her wedding. And now the whole Jed thing has me not wanting to listen to another episode. That whole thing of inviting him to perform was planned and extremely inauthentic (producer Amy is annoying) and why are y’all giving him any kind of platform after how he handled things? Had that been Ashley instead of Hannah she would have exiled him from bachelor nation.\\nAnd inviting Luke Pell on to speak about it when Luke Pell did the SAME THING?!? And we aren’t even gonna mention that?

       "505722   I am beyond disgusted with what this podcast has turned into! I used to love this podcast but with this last episode I have to draw the line. Ashley came off like an obnoxious little brat and the cackling guests in the back Krystal & Amanda need to GO! Ashley was so into bashing barb and seeing the situation one sided that the entire episode recap came off very amateur, childish and unprofessional.

       "505792   I used to love this podcast. I think Ben and Ashley have kind hearts and truly care about people. There has been a shift the last few months- where they almost seem scared to disagree with guests because of how they might appear. They seem scared of being called out by liberal listeners.  I’m an independent voter- I like to hear both sides. But it’s very clear there is only one voice allowed on both the podcast and in the Almost Famous group. I cannot believe the bullying going on in there! And the censorship is sad. The group is one sided now. We all know Ben is conservative, but he is scared to use his voice out of fear for his career (along with many other members of Bach Nation). Ben, don’t be scared. Be authentic as you always say. There will be more people behind you than you think. Don’t cower to the loud crowd. Ashley, you’ve always asked the best questions. Don’t back down and be scared to disagree or have a different view. Balance is being lost, and those of us on the fence can see it very clearly. I unsubscribed to both the FB group and your podcast today because I don’t want to support any business that supports censorship and bullying. I want adult discussion with varying views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "505995   I used to love this podcast. I loved their dynamic and now I find my self just skipping through it because all the ads and bens preaching when all we really want to hear is the bachelor nation gossip. This last podcast took TWENTY minutes to get to the actual content. That is ridiculous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "506375   I love Ben and ashley and I used to love this podcast when it first started. They used to give you tea from bachelor behind this scenes and gave honest opinions.. they hold back so much now you can tell it’s so unnatural. Idk if they have some deal with ABC or something they can’t say as much? They also rarely host together anymore. Idk it’s just sad because I used to love this podcast but it’s gone down hill.

       "506430   I used to love this podcast because I love Ben (sorry, but Ashley has always been an annoying attention hungry person). But lately Ben just sounds like a politician. And why do we always need to “write in to the podcast”? No one’s emails get ready on the pod, so it’s pointless.\\nI’m so over Ashley sticking up for her Bachelor friends no matter what they do, and crucifying anyone not in her camp.\\nSo sad but not listening anymore!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "506473   1st strike, there are SOO many ads. 2nd strike, the sound quality can be really iffy. 3rd strike, Ashley will not stop defending Luke P. 4th strike, the hosts are often not on episodes together, it’s basically an Ashley I wedding podcast. We get it, you’re getting married girl. 5th strike (because I used to love this podcast so I really tried to stick through), Ashley spoke poorly of Big Mike based only off of a “2 minute conversation”  though he seemed like a wonderful human this season on air, knowing that Hannah openly gives her full support for him, and he is in line to be the first Bachelor of color.

       "582946   Update (6/10/19):  the Justin Long episode was the end for me. For whatever reason, Monica wasn’t there for the first 20 minutes and the conversation between Dax and Justin was great. Then she showed up with her baby voice and stuttered laugh and I had to turn it off. I won’t be listening to this podcast anymore.\\n\\nOriginal review:  I used to love this podcast. Loved Dax and Monica’s friendship. Now that Conan’s podcast is available, though, I realize Dax’s has some issues. It’s WAY too long. Dax talks about himself too much instead of listening to his guests. So often he says “for me...” or, “in my case...” and then repeats something he’s said 100s of times before. We get it. The inside jokes between Dax and Monica are tedious. The baby talk is annoying. I no longer find the show cute or endearing. I used to listen regardless of whether I was a fan of the guest or not. Now I’m much more selective.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

I thought Kim’s mantra was all about positivity but she’s nothing but negative toward life, her experiences, and rude toward her husband. They complain and talk badly about neighbors or restaurants, or teammates incessantly and I always feel negative and uncomfortable when listening and it puts me in a bad mood. And don’t get me started on her getting angry about people not donating to her charity of choice. The positive segment couldn’t be more rushed and disingenuous.

They also act as if they “gave” us almost 100 podcast episodes, but they get paid for the podcast episodes and have more ads than almost any other podcast I listen to.\\n\\nI’m disappointed and will stop listening                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "612287   I used to love this podcast, but Kaitlyn has become very self-centered and talks much more about herself than her guests. I leave the episodes feeling like I barely got to know the guest at all because of her interuptions. She also repeats her stories over and over and over again.  In addition, all of the fillers/botox she has gotten in her lips has made her more difficult to understand, which is not good for a podcast host.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "612579   Update:: I had to turn off the episode with her and Jason recapping the bachelor. I was excited to hear their opinion on the Chase Rice situation but Kaitlyn was so dismissive of EVERYTHING Jason had to say and I was really excited to hear his point of view but she shut him down and sh*t in his every word. It was so frustrating as a listener. I turned it off and do not know when I will listen again. Poor Jason.\\n\\nI used to LOVE this podcast. It legit was the only podcast I listened too, now I just skim the title and usually skip past it.\\n\\nIt just isn’t the same. \\n\\nAnd just so you know, I am not a troll. I was a true fan from the moment she stepped out of the limo on bachelor.  I still love her Instagram stuff and think she is a great little businesswoman but wish the podcast would re-evaluate and get back to its roots.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "612597   Used to love this podcast and gave it 5 stars but she talks about the same exact things in every podcast. The same stories on the bachelor and bachelorette, how drunk she gets or how much she like tequila and wine, and then poop and fart jokes (which can be funny in moderation).

       "612890   I used to love the podcast. Kaitlyn was unfiltered and so hilarious. It felt very empowering and a sort of “girl tribe”. Lately she brings Jason in way too often to “cohost” and for interviews where it doesn’t even make sense for him to be there. He is too “polished”, corrects her too much, and does way too much mansplaining. He thinks he knows better and cuts Kaitlyn and her guests off often. The episode with Shawn Johnson was cringe worthy, he was telling Shawn it wasn’t “that hard to raise a girl”, when he doesn’t have children, he doesn’t have her experiences, and Shawn was expressing her worries. He was on for the Bella Twins podcast which made no sense. Kaitlyn was stronger and funnier on her own.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "613114   I’ve loved Kaitlyn since Chris Soules season of the bachelor. And I used to love this podcast too, listened every week. I don’t know if I started losing interest or if my podcast taste just matured but this become one I only listened too if I liked the guest. But now.... I can’t even do that. Listen to the first 3 minutes of the episode with Wells and that will pretty much sum up the content of this entire “brand” 1) Kaitlyn talking about how much she likes the sound of her voice. 2) Kaitlyn talking about herself some more and 3) an ad not even 2 minutes in that is obviously not carefully selected by what her listeners would find useful but probably what made her the most money. \\n\\nThe rest of the reviews aren’t lying. If you like to listen to ads & hear the same store over and over and over again this is the podcast for you.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "613122   Used to love this podcast (literally gave it a 5-star review just months ago) but it feels like there are too many episodes usually with random updates on Kaitlyn’s life, hardly any content or focus anymore, a clickbait title, and a ton of ads. Nothing wrong with updates on your life, but when you’re coming out with 3 episodes a week, how much of an update can there be? Kaitlyn has said before it’s hard to find new content and guests for so many episodes a week — so cut them down???!? (That seems like common sense???)\\n\\nToo many episodes has made it watered down. I’d prefer one REALLY good episode a week that’s actually focused on the topic it’s titled rather than a bunch of what feels like half-assed podcasts. It doesn’t feel like there’s any planned content. It’s just Kaitlyn in front of a mic saying whatever comes to mind and it’s not interesting anymore. It all just feels like clickbait and no content and exploiting her listeners for money.\\n\\nPrime example: the recent “Bachelor in Paradise finale” episode had less than 5 MINUTES about the finale which she said she didn’t even watch (!?), an awful 10-min Botox ad, and then 20+ mins about her relationship with Jason, her struggle with anxiety and Q&A about herself. If you want your podcast to be random content, fine, but don’t call it an episode about the BIP finale when you spent more time in the half-hour episode talking about your dog. Come on.\\n\\nI’d really like to see the podcast improve... Kaitlyn used to be so funny and enjoyable to listen to - she can make any guest laugh. It just feels like it’s going downhill, and based on the overwhelmingly negative reviews in the past few months, it looks like I’m not alone in feeling this way. It’s reasons like this I’ve unsubscribed. I hope you listen to people’s feedback. We’re all saying the same things.\\n\\nFrom a former fan   \n",

Jason’s negativity makes it a very tough listen. 2 hours of depression every week. I wish there was a faster playback option than 2x so I could get through this faster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "887616   Used to love this podcast and Rachel before it turned into the Rachel’s Way show. I respect her opinions and many are very valid. However, with Rachel you either are on her side and share her exact views or you are immediately canceled. And that does not create a healthy environment for positive change. You can hear the guilt and shame she instilled in Becca in both podcasts. If you want people to support and listen, stop coming after the people who think a little differently than you do. They’re not bad people if they make mistakes or don’t fully agree with everything you believe in. Rachel wants her agenda promoted and only hers alone, it’s exhausting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "888013   I’ve been a faithful listener since this podcast started. Truly. However it has descended into being so critical of the people that they have a bias against.

Everyone comes from different backgrounds, therefore everyone’s life experiences will be different. That’s OKAY!! We can support black lives, and support police!! It’s called being a decent human!
